## **üìä About the Dataset**

This project combines multiple datasets to deliver comprehensive insights for location feasibility analysis:

- **Property Data**: Details such as price, square footage, property type, and geographic coordinates, sourced from CREXi.
- **Demographics Data**: Population density, income levels, and employment statistics, obtained from the U.S. Census Bureau API.
- **Traffic Data**: Average Daily Traffic (ADT) and proximity to public transport, sourced from the Google Maps API.
- **Competitor Data**: Information about nearby competitors, including business types, ratings, and reviews, collected from Google Places API and Yelp API.
