# AI-Powered Business Location Feasibility Analysis

This project leverages **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** to provide actionable insights for selecting optimal business locations. The platform integrates data from multiple sources, such as demographics, traffic metrics, and competitor analysis, to predict the feasibility and success potential of a business at a given location.

## **Key Features**
- **Multi-Source Data Integration**:
  - Demographics (population density, income levels, spending behavior).
  - Traffic metrics (average daily traffic, public transport proximity).
  - Competitor analysis (density, sentiment analysis, market saturation).
- **Machine Learning Models**:
  - Competitor-level model to predict competitor success probabilities.
  - Property-level model to compute business suitability and category fit scores.
- **Actionable Outputs**:
  - Business Suitability Score (BSS).
  - Longevity Score.
  - Category Fit Score.
